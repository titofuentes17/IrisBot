Iris Bot is a simple but powerful and useful discord bot developed in python focused on giving league of legends stats to players trough discord, without needing to access other webpages.

It provides Useful stats for players and can aswell give info of the players you are playing with/facing off a game! 

Despite the bot being already a finished useable version, im still working on it, so its still open to new features and commands so feel free to coment, link or suggest any changes!
